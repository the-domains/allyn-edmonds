# **Christmas 2015**

The end of the year has come and what a year it has been. Some terrible lows and some not so high highs. Both my parents passed away this year which is the lowest of the lows. It's been a incredibly difficult thing to deal with but we're getting through it one day at a time.

Ayane has been up to her usual busy self with all of her activities. Lets see, ballet, tap, jazz, swimming, piano, ice skating, skiing, gymnastics and Japanese school. Boy she does a lot. Hopefully she's having lots of fun and learning a lot as well.
