# Another Year Gone

We've come to the end of another year and so it goes. This year has been a difficult one for me personally. Trying to find a suitable job, the death of my parents, and the loss of some friends has taken a toll on me over the year.

Work is work and we all know how that game is played, no need to go further down that rabbit hole.

The death of my parents, first my mother on August 28 and then my father 5 days later, was a real shock to not only myself, but to my brothers and aunt as well.

I guess as a normal kid you don't think that your parents are ever going to leave you, but that wasn't the case for me. I knew from a young age, from a conversation I had with my father when we lived on the Stanford campus, that one day he and my mother would pass away. I cried and I cried and told him that I didn't want him to die. He told me that it would be a while before that so I shouldn't worry. he was right, it was a long time before having to face the fact that they were gone. However, I think I was preparing myself for the eventuality since then.

The idea was always in my head that someday I would need to take care of myself and that my parents would not be around to see me through things. Although I never did it successfully until I was in my 30's I always tried to be independent and take care of myself. In my 30's I was finally able to do it because of some actions that I took. I didn't visit my parents that much. I always said it was because they lived to far away or some other nonsense, but it was never that. It was because I was trying to distance myself from them so the pain of them dying would not consume me in the end.

This tactic worked very well, but after they were gone I regretted it. Why, because doing this didn't allow me to see my mother for almost a year before she died. The last time I saw her was a Thanksgiving the year before, I was to have gone to see her int he hospital that Sunday after she passed. but she passed and I was unable to.
