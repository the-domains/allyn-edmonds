# Family

Because of the trajedy my brothers an aunt had to face in     2015, we've had to come together to take care of my mother and fathers personal belongings. it not only did that but it also made me see the importance of getting things in order for my own passing.

I'll tell you that during times like these it is so important to have family around. I don't know what I would have done if they all weren't there.
